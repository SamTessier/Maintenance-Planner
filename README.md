# Maintenance-Planner
 
<p> This is my very first project ever, thanks to Get Coding! <br>
<br>The purpose of this project is to help businesses who rely on a fleet of vehicles (like taxis, heavy equipment, or rental companies) to keep track of their fleet's maintenance and upkeep. In my previous work experience, I saw the need for a simple, user-friendly program to replace the antiquated and far-more-common-than-you-would-think "whiteboard method" of tracking fleet maintenance that is prone to errors and lacks mobility. </br>
<br>To use it, create a "fleet" by adding the information of each vehicle, and then you can quickly view the operational status of each, or add and view a work order to keep track of upcoming service.</br> 
<br> It is a work in progress - things like the checkbox will be replaced with icons, and the "additional action required" input field currently does nothing ðŸ˜Š I plan to create more iterations of the program as I expand my skillset and learn more frameworks. </br>Let me know what you think!
