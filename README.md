# Maintenance-Planner
 
<p> This is my very first project ever, thanks to <a href="https://www.getcoding.ca/">Get Coding!</a> <br>
Created using jQuery & Bootstrap </br>
<br>The purpose of my <a href="https://samtessier.github.io/Maintenance-Planner/">Maintenance Planner</a> project is to help businesses who rely on a fleet of vehicles (like taxis, heavy equipment, or rental companies) to keep track of their fleet's maintenance and upkeep. In my previous work experience, I saw the need for a simple, user-friendly program to replace the antiquated and far-more-common-than-you-would-think "whiteboard method" of tracking fleet maintenance that is prone to errors and lacks mobility. </br>
<br>To use it, simply click the link above, then you can create a "fleet" by adding the information of each vehicle, and then you can quickly view the operational status of each, or add and view a work order to keep track of upcoming service.</br> 
<br> It is a work in progress - you can't currently view work order details outside of the console, things like the checkbox will be replaced with icons, and the "additional action required" input field currently does nothing ðŸ˜Š I plan to create more iterations of the program as I expand my skillset and learn more frameworks, and dream of one day having access across multiple devices so that updates can be made by employees in real time.</br><br>Let me know what you think!</br>
<br>Enormous thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rubenchevez/">Ruben Chevez-Guardado</a> for the invaluable guidance along the way, and to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattjamesk/">Matt Kennedy</a> for the UX/UI tips!
